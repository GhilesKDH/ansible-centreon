# snmpd.conf:
#   An example configuration file for configuring the ucd-snmp snmpd agent.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This file is intended to only be as a starting point.  Many more
# configuration directives exist than are mentioned in this file.  For 
# full details, see the snmpd.conf(5) manual page.
#
# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are intended for you
# to read.  All other lines are configuration commands for the agent.

# Access Control
###############################################################################

# As shipped, the snmpd demon will only respond to queries on the
# system mib group until this file is replaced or modified for
# security purposes.  Examples are shown below about how to increase the
# level of access.

# By far, the most common question I get about the agent is "why won't
# it work?", when really it should be "how do I configure the agent to
# allow me to access it?"
#
# By default, the agent responds to the "public" community for read
# only access, if run out of the box without any configuration file in 
# place.  The following examples show you other ways of configuring
# the agent so that you can change the community names, and give
# yourself write access to the mib tree as well.
#
# For more information, read the FAQ as well as the snmpd.conf(5)
# manual page.

####
# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"

#       sec.name  source          community
com2sec notConfigUser  default       {{ snmp_community }}

####
# Second, map the security name into a group name:

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser
group   notConfigGroup v2c           notConfigUser

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

# Make at least  snmpwalk -v 1 localhost -c public system fast again.
#       name           incl/excl     subtree         mask(optional)
view centreon included .1.3.6.1
view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
view    systemview    included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1

####
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
access notConfigGroup "" any noauth exact centreon none none
access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none

# System contact information
#

# It is also possible to set the sysContact and sysLocation system
# variables through the snmpd.conf file:

syslocation Unknown (edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf)
syscontact Root <root@localhost> (configure /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf)

# Example output of snmpwalk:
#   % snmpwalk -v 1 localhost -c public system
#   system.sysDescr.0 = "SunOS name sun4c"
#   system.sysObjectID.0 = OID: enterprises.ucdavis.ucdSnmpAgent.sunos4
#   system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (595637548) 68 days, 22:32:55
#   system.sysContact.0 = "Me <me@somewhere.org>"
#   system.sysName.0 = "name"
#   system.sysLocation.0 = "Right here, right now."
#   system.sysServices.0 = 72

# Logging
#

# We do not want annoying "Connection from UDP: " messages in syslog.
# If the following option is commented out, snmpd will print each incoming
# connection, which can be useful for debugging.

dontLogTCPWrappersConnects yes
